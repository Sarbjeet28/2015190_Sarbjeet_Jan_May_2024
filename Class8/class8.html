        <h2>Lord Byron, 'She Walks in Beauty'</h2>
        <p><b>She walks in beauty, like the night<br>
            Of cloudless climes and starry skies;<br>
            And all that’s best of dark and bright<br>
            Meet in her aspect and her eyes;<br>
            Thus mellowed to that tender light<br>
            Which heaven to gaudy day denies...<br>

            One shade the more, one ray the less,<br>
            Had half impaired the nameless grace<br>
            Which waves in every raven tress,<br>
            Or softly lightens o’er her face;<br>
            Where thoughts serenely sweet express,<br>
            How pure, how dear their dwelling-place...<br>
            
            And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,<br>
            So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,<br>
            The smiles that win, the tints that glow,<br>
            But tell of days in goodness spent,<br>
            A mind at peace with all below,<br>
            A heart whose love is innocent!</b></p>
